The first group project in which I took part in the 4th week of the <Academia de CÃ³digo_> #47 Bootcamp @Porto.

//The ideia
We had the challenge to develop a game within a week and we decided to remake the old classic snake.
The game the goal is for the snake to eat apples and score. Golden apples gives you more points. If the snake bites itself or crashes against one of the walls, you lose!

//The Development
We worked together when building the basic functionality of the game, once we reached the minimum viable product we divided the work into extra features and individually worked on them.
We used the Simple Graphics library for the development of the graphical interface.

//My Role
Along with my colleagues we created the basic's project architecture and I focused mainly on the logic and movement of the snake.

//Tech && Methodologies
OOP, Java, Git, Ant, IntelliJ
